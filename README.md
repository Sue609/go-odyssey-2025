# 🚀 Go Journey 2025

Welcome to my **Golang learning adventure (2025 edition)**.  
This repository is my playground, lab, and diary for exploring **Go** — as a hobby first, but also as a skill to sharpen my backend engineering craft.  

## ✨ Why this repo?
- To fall in love with the **process of coding**, not just the outcome.  
- To document my growth step by step.  
- To have fun while building projects, big or small.  

## 📂 Structure
- `basics/` → Go syntax, fundamentals, tiny snippets.  
- `exercises/` → practice challenges to flex problem-solving.  
- `projects/` → mini tools, APIs, and fun applications.  
- `notes/` → my own notes and takeaways while learning.  
- `experiments/` → a sandbox for testing random Go ideas.  

## 🛠️ Tools
- Language: [Go](https://go.dev/)  
- Editor: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  
- Extensions: Go (by the Go Team), GitLens, etc.  

## 🎯 Goals
- [ ] Refresh my coding muscle memory.  
- [ ] Build consistency (just like the gym 🏋️).  
- [ ] Create small but real-world useful Go projects.  
- [ ] Keep coding fun and stress-free.
